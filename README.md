Hi, I’m @EdwFa  - 👋
I am interested in applied botany - 👀 
Now, I am studying dialects of the Yoruba language (there are about 20 of them): oyo, ekiti, egba, ijebu, ijesh, ife, igbomin, onda, ovo, yagba and others... - 🌱 
I am looking for partners for cooperation or colabpration in the study of influence of the solar wind force on pathological changes in the psyche of the population living in the northern hemisphere - 💞️
